= blueprint

Blueprint is a DSL that allows creating MyStacks and CommunityStacks to be deployed on Webbynode. 

The current incarnation is to be considered early alpha, and only builds the Hash required to describe the components of the Stack.

As code advances, this will become a full API for interacting with Webbynode and maintaining stacks.
